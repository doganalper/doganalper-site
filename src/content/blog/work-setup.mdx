import ContentLink from 'src/components/ContentLink.astro'

I have been using <ContentLink href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" text="VSCode" isOutLink /> since I started coding in high school and haven't learned how to use it properly since that day. While using it, it was perfect for me. I could do what I needed to do and just that.

And there is but (always there must be a but...) I think it is overloaded with lots of stuff I don't need in general. And why have them there if I'm not going to use them, right? And believe me, this situation bugged me even more when I tried using <ContentLink href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" text="WebStorm" isOutLink/>. I used it only to try how it is to work with fully functioning IDE and it was good not going to lie. Things such as separating a section of code to another file as a Vue component was very good functionality but again I wasn't going to use it many times.

Summer of 2022 was the era that I have been introduced to Vim bindings... I couldn't just jump to using vim directly but needed check how shallow water was by using Vim plugin inside both VSCode and WebStorm. And I struggled, like a lot. I was just jumping without intention, deleting things I should not have and worst was when I needed to do some pair programming with my coworkers... I mostly disabled plugin and work like how I have been doing since high school, using mouse lots of times.

Of course by time (and with not giving up) I get used to vim motions (mostly...) and wanted to use Vim as standalone text editor. It was even worst that I had imagined how it would be. I could not understand what was going on with configurations, how to use plugins, how to add custom keybindings etc. But thanks to <ContentLink href="https://neovim.io/" text="Neovim" isOutLink /> it uses more modern scripting language called <ContentLink href="https://www.lua.org/" text="Lua" isOutlink />.

I really start loving it what I used Lazy for plugin management because it helped me to understand how lua works under the hood, how config can be seperatable into modules (ofc you can also not split config and have all configuration inside one file, like <ContentLink href="https://arslan.io/2023/05/10/the-benefits-of-using-a-single-init-lua-vimrc-file/" text="Fatih" isOutLink /> does.)

And also I recently started using <ContentLink href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" text="Tmux" isOutLink />. There was no specific reason honestly, just thought it looked good and I wanted to look cool ðŸ˜Ž.

Using tmux and neovim may not be newest thing in sector maybe but it is new and refreshing for me and not using mouse for most of the time helped me to focus more on my code and spent less time to look for a button that I need to click for doing simple thing. If I need to use that functionality often, I create a command for that functionality and it is two (sometimes three) button presses on keyboard.

This is a brief explanation what I use daily to write and learn coding and I might update this text by the time. And <ContentLink href="https://github.com/doganalper/dotfiles" text="here" isOutLink /> is my configuration files for Neovim, Tmux and <ContentLink href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty" text="Kitty" isOutLink/>.
