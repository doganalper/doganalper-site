			I am a frontend developer from Türkiye 🇹🇷.
			<br />
			Most of my hobbies are centered around staying inside, such as
			reading non-fiction novels, philosophy and technology and playing
			video games 🕹️.
			<br />
			I also like to visit local museums and try new foods from different
			cultures 🧆. <br />
			I am currently learning Spanish (Hola, todo 👋🏼) and want to improve
			my writing skills by writing more on my blog.
